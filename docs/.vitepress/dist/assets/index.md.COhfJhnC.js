While the current Golang mentality is often about &quot;building from scratch&quot; and wiring libraries together, we believe there is a massive space for a framework that utilizes Golang&#39;s raw speed while providing the superior Developer Experience (DX) of Rails or Phoenix.</p><h2 id="performance" tabindex="-1">Performance <a class="header-anchor" href="#performance" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Performance&quot;">​</a></h2><div class="language- vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang"></span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span>BenchmarkGoryu_JSON-8         1,245,364 ops/sec    967.2 ns/op</span></span>

Unlike other &quot;heavy&quot; frameworks that rely on complex meta-programming or runtime reflection that obscures logic, Goryu prefers explicit, readable Go code.</p></li><li><p><strong>Performance matters</strong> Because blazingly fast performance is essential.
